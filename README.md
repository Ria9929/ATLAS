A chatbot you can play a geographical "shiritori"-like game with.<br/>
Shiritori  is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word. No distinction is made between hiragana, katakana or kanji. "Shiritori" literally means "taking the end" or "taking the rear".<br/>
Similarly here, you play a word-chain game against the bot using only names of countries/capitals and no name/word can be repeated.<br/>
You can use a Google Colab notebook and import it to run . Also make sure to download the "Countries.csv" file and upload it to the colab.
